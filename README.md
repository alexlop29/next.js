### Notes
> All content that is available to non-assistive technology users must be made available to assistive technologies. Similarly, no features should be included targeting assistive technology users that aren't also accessible to those not using assistive technologies.

## Definitions
> Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of roles and attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.

> Test your authored ARIA with actual assistive technology.
