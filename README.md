### Notes
> All content that is available to non-assistive technology users must be made available to assistive technologies. Similarly, no features should be included targeting assistive technology users that aren't also accessible to those not using assistive technologies.

> ...adding accessibility features to Next.js by default.

> Next.js provides an integrated ESLint experience out of the box, including custom rules for Next.js. By default, Next.js includes eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y to help catch accessibility issues early.

## Definitions
> Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of roles and attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.

> Test your authored ARIA with actual assistive technology.
